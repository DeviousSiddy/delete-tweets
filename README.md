Decided to make my own script to delete tweets based on keywords.

If you use this, please read up on Twitter API and generation of keys and tokens.
Also about requesting a backup of your tweets in Twitter settings.

Most of the work was done using GPT.

I had a basic design based on @koenrh's repo, but it assumes a CSV file as backup.
I do not know if this is antiquated, but now if you ask Twitter for a backup of your tweets you get JSON files.
This script only needs the "tweets.js" file.

Most likely I am not updating this further so... have at it.
